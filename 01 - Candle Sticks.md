# Candlestick Pattern Analysis - README

## Overview
This document serves as a guide to understanding candlestick patterns, focusing on the importance of wicks and doji candles. By analyzing these patterns, traders can gain insights into market sentiment, potential reversals, and continuation signals.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Doji Candles
- **Definition**: A doji candle has a small body, indicating that the opening and closing prices are very close.
- **Significance**: Doji candles represent market indecision. Depending on their location in a trend, they can signal potential reversals or continuation.

### 2. Wicks (Shadows)
- **Definition**: Wicks are the lines above and below the body of a candlestick, representing the high and low prices during the period.
- **Significance**: Long wicks can indicate rejection from certain price levels, showing areas of support or resistance.

## Analyzing Candlestick Patterns

### Example Patterns

1. **Bullish Doji**
   - **Description**: A small body with long wicks on both sides, appearing after a downtrend.
   - **Interpretation**: Indicates potential reversal to the upside, especially if followed by a bullish candle.

2. **Bearish Doji**
   - **Description**: Similar to a bullish doji but appears after an uptrend.
   - **Interpretation**: Suggests potential reversal to the downside.

3. **Strong Close Candle**
   - **Description**: A full-bodied candle with minimal wicks.
   - **Interpretation**: Indicates strong momentum in the direction of the close.

### Homework Task

1. Choose a trading pair (e.g., **SDS**, **GU**, **DJ**).
2. Analyze the chart to spot:
   - Doji candles.
   - Candles with significant wicks.
3. Find at least **ten examples** and observe how the market reacts to these patterns.

## Practical Application

- **Step 1**: Identify doji candles and note their position in the trend.
- **Step 2**: Observe the length of wicks and their direction.
- **Step 3**: Watch subsequent price action to see if the patterns indicate reversal or continuation.
- **Step 4**: Record findings and review how these patterns fit into your trading strategy.

## Conclusion
